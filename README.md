# No Mandatory Arbitration

_(inspired by [Hiring Without Whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards))_

A list of companies (or teams) that don't require signing a Forced/Mandatory Arbitration clause as part of an employment contract or job offer. 

Please open a [PR](https://github.com/mandatory-arbitration/no-mandatory-arbitration/pull/new/master) to be added.

### Duds

If you've seen a recent contract from one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a [PR](https://github.com/mandatory-arbitration/no-mandatory-arbitration/pull/new/master) to remove them from this list.
